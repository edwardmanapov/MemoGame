## Web-based Application

### Introduction
A web based game is much easier than most junior programmers think.
We are not talking about a 3D game with special effects, but a simple two dimension game. A
quick loaded game with no registration required, only a player name needed to keep the high score.
A game that can easily set on the side bar of our website to keep engaged our visitors with slow
internet connection. As an example, when someone waits for a video to get buffered with a poor
connection a “spent time” game would be on point.

### Brief Overview
It’s so simple, a board that contains twenty four tiles flipped back, where under each one, one letter
is hidden. Once the user clicks on one tile it flips over and the letter reveals. Hitting another tile will
make it flip so another letter is shown. If the letters match the tiles remain flipped on the front side.
Otherwise the flipped back again. Once user had found all the pair tiles hidden, another board is
loaded with different random generated letters behind.
