### Brief Overview
Itâ€™s so simple, a board that contains twenty four tiles flipped back, where under each one, one letter
is hidden. Once the user clicks on one tile it flips over and the letter reveals. Hitting another tile will
make it flip so another letter is shown. If the letters match the tiles remain flipped on the front side.
Otherwise the flipped back again. Once user had found all the pair tiles hidden, another board is
loaded with different random generated letters behind. High Score and Player Name are stored in a local database.
